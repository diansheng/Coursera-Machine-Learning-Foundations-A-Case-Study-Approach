# coursera_machine_learning_specialziation
A place to hold source code or python notebook for my work for this coursera specialization.

I would like to use this place to share course related information with other certificate seekers.
The course content is not as flat as a plain paper. I guess some quiz and assignment could be rather tough for those with weaker programming and maths background. So I will try to present my work for the quizs and assignment clearly. Hope everyone gets the most from the course.

**Disclaimer**
The main purpose is not to help people cheat for certificates, but rather to share peer works for better course understanding.

##Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach##

Someone has posted answers to quiz and assignment [here](https://da8y01.github.io/gh-blog/2015/12/26/machine-learning-specialization-1.html). Although a few questions have changed by now, it still serves as a good reference.
You can find the source code for my assignment in the ipynb files under the corresponding folders. The codes are marked as *# Assignment Quiz X* so that you can easily find it.
